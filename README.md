# Active Northwest Multisport Event

This is a fictional website for a sports event company in Portland Oregon which organizes and sponsors an inclusive running and triathlon event weekend every year for athletes of all physical abilities, national origins, gender identifications and cultural backgrounds.

## Website Features

The website was built with HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript. It uses the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to display real-time local weather data in the front-end, and it connects to a MySQL database in the back-end for gathering and storing user registrations from an HTML form.

**Prominent features include:**

* Mobile-first responsive layout
* Local weather widget written in vanilla JavaScript using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
* Registration form that gathers and stores user data in a MySQL database
* Contact form for emailing administrators through SMTP
